The goal of refq_choropleth_slider was to demonstrate how to generate a plotly choropleth with a slider filtering the year.  As the plot turns, I've decided that a slider filter with geom_sf polygons is not a feasible goal.  BUT, animating the choropleth via `gganimate` seems to work well.

The best documentation for annimation will be found in the `gganimate.Rmd` file.  The other files were exploring how `plotly` and `crosstalk` could be used to add a filter slider to the map.  Those efforts proved less than idea.

However, those efforts spawned learning more about gganimate.  Summary code and output is below.

## Examnple of `transition_time`

```
ggplot(bg_r) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = estimate, color = estimate)) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {round(frame_time, 0)}') +
  transition_time(as.numeric(year)) +
  shadow_mark(past = TRUE, future = TRUE)
```

## Example of `transition_filter`

```r
ggplot(bg_r) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = estimate, color = estimate)) +
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  labs(title = '{next_expression}') +
  transition_filter(transition_length = 0.4, 
                    filter_length = 0.4,
                    year == "2013",
                    year == "2014",
                    year == "2015",
                    year == "2016") +
  enter_fade() +
  exit_fade() +
  shadow_mark(past = TRUE, future = TRUE)
```

Example of funking around with stringr to manipulate the label variables (see `transition_` [documentation](https://gganimate.com/reference/) for more)

```r

yrs_txt <- c("2013", "2014", "2015", "2016")

ggplot(bg_r_small) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = estimate, color = estimate)) +
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  labs(title = "YEAR: {str_replace(str_replace(as.character(next_expression), 'year == \"', ''), '\"', '')}") +
  transition_filter(transition_length = 0.4, 
                    filter_length = 0.4,
                    year == "2013",
                    year == "2014",
                    year == "2015",
                    year == "2016") +
  enter_fade() +
  exit_fade() +
  shadow_mark(past = TRUE, future = TRUE)
```
